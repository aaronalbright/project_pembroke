# Project Pembroke (working title)

This project was designed to help people understand their car's dashboard warnings a little better and inform them of the potential cost of neglecting maintenance.

At the end, it will be a progressive web app that will work offline.

## How it works

Data is pulled in from a JSON file and funneled through a Handlebars script to generate each dashboard warning. When a warning is clicked, the information is pushed into the respective sections.

The Check Engine icon is unique in that it contains more data and visualizations sourced from CarMD's 2016 Vehicle Health Index. This data contains average cost of repairs for the check engine light along with the top 10 reasons the light was on.

## To-do
* Reverse CSS open/close animation
* Create about page
* Come up with new title
* Every icon has information/data
* Complete Check Engine data visuals
* Deploy as offline-able progressive web app
